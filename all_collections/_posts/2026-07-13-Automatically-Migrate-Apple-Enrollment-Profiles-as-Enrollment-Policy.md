After I wrote about [migrating Apple ADE enrollment profiles to the new enrollment policies](/posts/Migrating-from-Apple-Enrollment-Profiles-to-the-Enrollment-Policies/), someone asked me on LinkedIn whether the recreation step could be scripted. The article covers that part manually: open the wizard, tick through every Setup Assistant screen, one profile at a time. That's fine for a single token with two or three profiles. It stops being fine once you're doing it across several enrollment program tokens with iOS and macOS profiles on each.

So I wrote `New-AdePolicyFromProfile.ps1` - a script that reads an existing classic enrollment profile and creates the equivalent Settings Catalog enrollment policy via Microsoft Graph, field by field, instead of clicking through it.

---

## What It Does

The script copies every classic profile field that has a direct equivalent on the new policy: user affinity and the Intune authentication method, locked enrollment, the device name template, department/phone, every Setup Assistant screen toggle that still exists, and - for macOS - the full nested local admin / primary account tree.

Two categories of fields don't get a straight copy:

- **Policy-only fields** - screens like Action Button, Terms of Address, Intelligence, or App Store never existed on the classic profile, so there's nothing to copy from. These get set to a default (Hide or Show, your choice) instead.
- **Profile-only fields** - things like Supervised mode, Shared iPad, session timeouts, or Apple Configurator certificates have no equivalent on the new policy at all. These are left out and listed in the script's summary output so you know what to configure manually afterwards.

The script only creates the policy. It doesn't assign it, set it as default, or touch existing devices - those stay separate, deliberate steps, same as in the manual walkthrough.

---

## Single Profile or Bulk

```powershell
# One profile
.\New-AdePolicyFromProfile.ps1 -ProfileName 'ABM-DeploymentProfile-iOS-WithUser-ModernAuthentication-[PI-Baseline]'

# Every classic profile on one token
.\New-AdePolicyFromProfile.ps1 -TokenName 'Intune PI Dev SST'
```

`-ProfileName` alone (optionally narrowed with `-TokenName`) targets a single profile. `-TokenName` on its own switches to bulk mode and migrates every classic profile still sitting on that token, skipping anything that's already a Settings Catalog policy so re-runs don't create duplicates of duplicates.

New policy names are derived automatically from my naming convention: `DeploymentProfile` in the old name becomes `EnrollmentPolicy`. If a profile doesn't follow the convention, single mode lets you override the name explicitly with `-NewPolicyName`, or reuse the old name as-is with `-AllowIdenticalName`. In bulk mode there's no way to supply a name per profile, so non-conforming profiles are skipped with a warning unless `-AllowIdenticalName` is set, in which case they get migrated under their existing name unchanged.

## Device Group - Single Mode Only

```powershell
.\New-AdePolicyFromProfile.ps1 -ProfileName 'ABM-DeploymentProfile-iOS-WithUser-ModernAuthentication-[PI-Baseline]' -DeviceGroupName 'MDM-iOS-ADE-Assigned'
```

`-DeviceGroupName` sets the policy's enrollment-time device group - the headline feature from the [previous article](/posts/Migrating-from-Apple-Enrollment-Profiles-to-the-Enrollment-Policies/#creating-a-new-enrollment-policy). It only works in single mode. In bulk mode there's no reliable way to know which group belongs to which profile without guessing, so I left it unsupported there rather than build something that silently assigns the wrong group.

This setting turned out to be the trickiest part of the whole script, for two reasons:

**It fails silently without the right permissions.** If the signed-in account or app doesn't have sufficient rights on the target group (Owner, in practice), the Graph call that sets the group returns success anyway - the policy gets created, just without the group attached, and nothing tells you that happened. The script now double-checks by calling `retrieveEnrollmentTimeDeviceMembershipTarget` after the fact and warns explicitly if the group didn't take.

**There's no obvious way to read it back.** The property I expected to hold the answer - `enrollmentTimeAzureAdGroupIds` on the classic profile mirror - turned out to be a leftover from an older concept and stays empty regardless. Neither `isAssigned` nor the policy's `/assignments` collection reflects it either. The actual readback is `retrieveEnrollmentTimeDeviceMembershipTarget`, a function on the policy that isn't discoverable from the Graph documentation or schema search - I only found it by capturing what the Intune portal itself calls when it shows you the device group tab, using [Graph X-Ray](https://graphxray.merill.net/), a browser extension that turns portal clicks into the underlying Graph API calls.

## New-Only Fields Default to Hide

```powershell
.\New-AdePolicyFromProfile.ps1 -ProfileName 'Old iOS Profile' -NewFieldDefault Show
```

Fields that only exist on the new policy - Action Button, Emergency SOS, Terms of Address, Intelligence, Lock Down Mode, App Store, and a handful of others depending on platform - have nothing on the old profile to copy from. By default the script hides them, matching what you'd get by leaving them untouched in the policy wizard. Pass `-NewFieldDefault Show` to flip that default for the whole run if you'd rather have them visible.

## Re-Running Safely

```powershell
.\New-AdePolicyFromProfile.ps1 -ProfileName 'ABM-DeploymentProfile-iOS-WithUser-ModernAuthentication-[PI-Baseline]' -WhatIf
```

Before creating a policy, the script checks whether one with the target name already exists and asks whether to create a duplicate anyway. `-Force` skips that prompt if you genuinely want a duplicate (for example, while iterating on `-NewFieldDefault`). `-WhatIf` is supported throughout for a dry run.

---

## Notes

A few things worth calling out if you're reading the script or adapting it:

- The `settingInstanceTemplateId` / `settingValueTemplateId` pairs hardcoded into the script were read back from real policies created in a test tenant (POST, then GET), not guessed from documentation. While I was pulling these together with Claude, it flagged that the GUIDs Microsoft assigned to some of the newer Setup Assistant screens looked suspiciously patterned - too sequential to be genuine, more like placeholders than real identifiers. That was enough to make me double- and triple-check those specific ones against live tenant data before trusting them.
- The macOS local admin / primary account settings form a nested tree that isn't obvious from the classic profile's flat property list. `createlocalprimary` is always nested under `createlocaladmin` regardless of either one's value; `prefillaccountinfo` (and the fields under it) only appears when `createlocalprimary` isn't "No"; and Graph requires `adminaccountpasswordrotation` as a mandatory sibling the moment `createlocaladmin` is "Yes" - leave it out and the policy creation fails with a 400.
- Editing an existing Settings Catalog enrollment policy in the portal to add a primary account _after_ creation can crash the properties editor (`Microsoft_Intune_Enrollment` / `PropertiesEditor.ReactView` fails to load). Setting every field at creation time, as this script does, avoids that path entirely.

The script is also available in my [Intune-Misc GitHub repo](https://github.com/SasStu/Intune-Misc), alongside the script from the [previous article](/posts/Migrating-from-Apple-Enrollment-Profiles-to-the-Enrollment-Policies/).

## The Complete Script

```powershell
#Requires -Version 7.2
#Requires -Modules Microsoft.Graph.Authentication

<#
.SYNOPSIS
    Creates a new Apple ADE Settings Catalog enrollment policy that replicates
    the settings of an existing classic enrollment profile.

.DESCRIPTION
    Intune's classic enrollment profiles (depIOSEnrollmentProfile /
    depMacOSEnrollmentProfile) are frozen - new Setup Assistant screens only
    land in the newer Settings Catalog enrollment policies
    (deviceManagement/configurationPolicies). Recreating a profile as a policy
    by hand in the GUI is the first step of the migration, field by field.
    This script automates that copy.

    Every classic boolean/string field that has a direct policy equivalent is
    copied across, including the nested macOS local admin / primary account
    tree. Setup Assistant screens that only exist on the new policy
    (Action Button, Terms of Address, Intelligence, etc.) have no source value
    to copy, so they are set to -NewFieldDefault instead. Fields that have no
    policy equivalent at all (Supervised mode, Shared iPad, session timeouts,
    Apple Configurator certificates, admin password rotation, ...) are left
    out and listed in the summary so you can configure them manually
    afterwards.

    The script creates policies directly via Graph, which sidesteps a known
    Intune portal bug: editing an existing Settings Catalog enrollment policy
    in the GUI to add a primary account afterwards can crash the properties
    editor (Microsoft_Intune_Enrollment / PropertiesEditor.ReactView fails to
    load). Setting the same fields at creation time, as this script does,
    works fine.

    The script only creates the policy - it does not assign it, set it as
    default, or set an enrollment-time device group. Those stay separate,
    deliberate steps.

.PARAMETER ProfileName
    Display name of the classic enrollment profile to copy. Mandatory unless
    -TokenName is given without it, in which case every classic profile on
    that token is migrated.

.PARAMETER TokenName
    Limit the run to a single enrollment program token. Mandatory if
    -ProfileName is omitted (bulk mode); optional as a narrowing filter when
    -ProfileName is given.

.PARAMETER NewPolicyName
    Optional. Only valid together with -ProfileName. Overrides the
    auto-derived policy name. Without it, the old profile name must contain
    the naming convention's 'DeploymentProfile' segment (e.g.
    'ABM-DeploymentProfile-iOS-...'), which is substituted with
    'EnrollmentPolicy'. In bulk mode (-TokenName only), profiles whose name
    doesn't follow the convention are skipped with a warning instead, unless
    -AllowIdenticalName is set.

.PARAMETER AllowIdenticalName
    When a profile's name doesn't contain the naming convention's
    'DeploymentProfile' segment, create the new policy under the exact same
    name as the old profile instead of erroring (single mode) or skipping it
    (bulk mode).

.PARAMETER DeviceGroupName
    Optional. Only valid together with -ProfileName (single mode) - a bulk
    run has no reliable way to know which group belongs to which profile, so
    it isn't supported there. Display name of an existing Entra ID security
    group to set as the policy's enrollment-time device group. Must resolve
    to exactly one group. The script verifies the assignment afterwards via
    retrieveEnrollmentTimeDeviceMembershipTarget and warns if it didn't take
    (e.g. the signed-in account/app lacks sufficient rights, such as Owner,
    on the group).

.PARAMETER NewFieldDefault
    'Show' or 'Hide' (default 'Hide'). Value applied to Setup Assistant
    screens and other settings that exist only on the new policy and have no
    classic profile field to copy from.

.PARAMETER Force
    Skip the confirmation prompt and create the policy even if one with the
    same name already exists (e.g. from a previous run). Without -Force, an
    existing policy with the target name is reported and you're asked
    whether to create a duplicate anyway.

## Summary

1. Point the script at a single profile with `-ProfileName`, or at a whole token with `-TokenName` to migrate everything on it in one run.
2. Let the naming convention derive the new policy name automatically, or override it with `-NewPolicyName` / `-AllowIdenticalName`.
3. Set the enrollment-time device group at the same time with `-DeviceGroupName` if you're doing a single profile - the script verifies it actually landed and warns if the calling account didn't have rights on the group.
4. Review the printed list of fields that couldn't be migrated automatically and configure those manually.
5. Continue with the rest of the migration from the [previous article](/posts/Migrating-from-Apple-Enrollment-Profiles-to-the-Enrollment-Policies/): test on a single device, set the policy as default, and reassign existing devices with `Set-AdeDevicesToEnrollmentPolicy.ps1`.

The script isn't a substitute for reviewing what gets created - it's a substitute for clicking through the same wizard fifteen times.
